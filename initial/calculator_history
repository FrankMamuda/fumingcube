Welcome to Fuming Cube<br>
<br>
This application simplifies various calculations performed performed by chemists.<br>
A list of common reagents and their properties can be easily created and used in the calculator.<br>
Reagent properties can be easily fetched from the internet and used as references.<br>
<br>
Here, try this example,<br>

5.0 * <a href="assay;TmFPSA==;ZGVtbw==">assay( "NaOH", "demo" )</a> / <a href="molarMass;TmFPSA==">molarMass( "NaOH" )</a><br>
= <a href="ans;0.124759356952">0.124759356952</a><br>
<br>
/*<br>
where we get mol from 5 grams of Sodium hydroxide.<br>
Calculator resolves references to assay and molar mass automatically.<br>
<br>
You can also write functions and references manually (autocomplete them with TAB).<br>
Or alternatively, paste references by double-clicking in the property window.<br>
<br>
Best of luck!<br>
