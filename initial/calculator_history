Welcome to Fuming Cube

This application simplifies various calculations performed performed by chemists.
A list of common reagents and their properties can be easily created and used in the calculator.
Reagent properties can be easily fetched from the internet and used as references.

Here, try this example,
*/

5.0 * assay( "NaOH", "demo" ) / molarMass( "NaOH" ) 
= 0.12475935695177139

/*
where we get mol from 5 grams of Sodium hydroxide.
Calculator resolves references to assay and molar mass automatically.

You can also write functions and references manually (autocomplete them with TAB).
Or alternatively, paste references by double-clicking in the property window.

Best of luck!
