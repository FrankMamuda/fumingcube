## Chemistry calculations simplified (alpha)

Applet is a simple mass/volume/mol calculator for everyday laboratory use. Uses sqlite database to store common reagent templates. Currently in **alpha**, so some features have not been implemented or do not work as intended.

Project goal is to create a powerful toolbox to simplify work in an organic chemistry lab.

**Fuming cube** is a pun on the 'flaming circle' symbol.
