**Fuming cube** does the following things:
 - it is a **chemical reagent management tool** (make lists of all your common reagents)
 - it keeps reagent **properties** in a database (such as molar mass, density, etc.)
 - it is an **interactive calculator** and uses reagent properties as references to simplify calculations.

Currently in **beta**, therefore some features are not quite polished and may not work as intended.

Project's goal is to create a powerful toolbox to simplify work in an organic chemistry lab.

**Fuming cube** is a pun on the 'flaming circle' pictogram.
